# Marcos Garcia — Author Website
Setup & publishing guide

Your site has 4 files:

- `index.html` — the page content
- `style.css` — the design (colors, type, layout)
- `script.js` — mobile menu + small interactions
- `images/author-photo.jpg` — your author photo (already added)

---

## 1. Before publishing — edit these placeholders

Your email, Instagram, and Spotify links are already filled in. Just one spot left — open `index.html` and update:

| Find | Replace with | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `https://amazon.com/author/yourname` | your Amazon author/book page URL | Contact section |
| `Purchase link coming soon` button `href="#"` | your real sales/store link | Featured Book section |

Each spot is marked with an `<!-- EDIT ME -->` comment in the code, so you can search for "EDIT ME" to find them fast.

Your author photo is already in place at `images/author-photo.jpg`. To swap it later, just replace that file with a new image of the same name (or update the `src` in `index.html`).

---

## 2. Put it on GitHub Pages

1. **Extract/save** all 4 files (and the `images` folder) together in one folder on your computer.
2. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create a **new public repository** (e.g. `marcos-garcia-author`).
3. Click **Add file → Upload files**, and upload:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `script.js`
   - the whole `images` folder (with `author-photo.jpg` inside)
4. Commit the upload.
5. In your repository, go to **Settings → Pages**.
6. Under **Build and deployment**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
7. Under **Branch**, choose **main** and **/ (root)**.
8. Click **Save**.

GitHub will build your site (takes 1–2 minutes) and show your public URL at the top of the Pages settings — typically:

```
https://your-username.github.io/marcos-garcia-author/
```

## 3. Making future edits

Any time you want to change text, links, or the photo:

1. Edit the file(s) locally, or directly on GitHub (click the pencil icon on a file).
2. Commit the change.
3. GitHub Pages automatically rebuilds — refresh your site in a minute or two to see it live.

## Notes

- The site is fully responsive (phone, tablet, desktop) and includes a collapsible mobile menu.
- No build tools, frameworks, or installs are required — it's plain HTML/CSS/JS.
- Fonts (Cormorant Garamond, Literata, Space Mono) load from Google Fonts automatically; no setup needed.
